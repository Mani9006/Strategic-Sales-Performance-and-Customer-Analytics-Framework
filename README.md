# **Strategic Sales Performance and Customer Analytics Framework**

## **Project Overview**
This project provides a data-driven framework for analyzing sales performance, customer behavior, and market trends. By leveraging Python for data analysis and visualization, and SQL for data preprocessing, the project extracts actionable insights from transactional records. The outcomes aim to support data-driven decision-making and optimize business strategies.

## **Key Features**
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Preprocessing and cleaning transactional sales data to retain significant records for meaningful insights.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**:
  - Monthly sales trends across regions.
  - Distribution of discounts applied in transactions.
  - Customer satisfaction ratings segmented by product categories.
- **Actionable Insights**: Highlights trends in customer behavior and performance metrics, aiding business operations and decision-making.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for creating insightful visualizations.
- **Database**: SQL (emulated using Python pandas for standalone analysis).

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains:
- **Transaction Details**: Sales amount, product category, discount applied, quantity sold, and more.
- **Customer Metrics**: Satisfaction ratings and repeat customer status.
- **Time-Series Information**: Sales date for temporal trend analysis.

## **Project Highlights**
1. **Data Cleaning and Filtering**: Ensures data consistency and removes irrelevant records.
2. **Sales Trends Analysis**: Uncovers regional trends over time to identify top-performing markets.
3. **Discount Utilization Patterns**: Analyzes how discounts influence transaction volumes.
4. **Customer Satisfaction Insights**: Identifies product categories with the highest satisfaction ratings.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository and upload the dataset (`Final_Sales_Performance_Data.csv`) to your Google Colab or Jupyter environment.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Refined_Sales_Performance_Project.ipynb`) to replicate the analysis and visualizations.
3. The cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_Sales_Performance_Data.csv`) will be saved for further use.

## **Results**
The project demonstrates the potential of leveraging Python and SQL for actionable business insights. It provides a foundation for integrating data analytics into strategic decision-making and improving operational efficiency.
